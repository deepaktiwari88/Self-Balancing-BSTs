# Self-Balancing-BSTs
A self-balancing binary search tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. It provides guaranteed O(logN) performance in case of insertion, deletion and search operations which can be O(N) in case of ordinary BST.
